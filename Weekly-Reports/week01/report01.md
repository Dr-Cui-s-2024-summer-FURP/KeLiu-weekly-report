### Isaac Sim
 - Isaac Sim is a simulation platform and is mainly applied in robotics, which can help develop and train smart robots. 
 - Utility: By using the Omniverse Isaac Sim software, we can synthesize some simulation data in the early stages of the project, collect a large amount of data in a short time, and perform intelligent benchmarking to help train some AI models. In the mid-stage of the project, based on this simulation data, we use Isaac Sim for model training and validation, as well as functionality verification of some navigation algorithms. In the later stages, we can use Isaac Sim to make comparison with data obtained in real environment and iteration to achieve efficiency optimization for example.
### USD （Universal Scene Description）
- An interchange file format to represent scenes in Isaac Sim. It is an easily extensible, open-source 3D scene description and file format developed by Pixar for content creation and interchange among different tools. 
## 2. Workstation Installation
The environment setup is completed on a lab machine in IAMET 406 because my PC does not have a RTX GPU to run the Isaac Sim.

- 1. Download Omniverse Launcher.
- 2. Install Omniverse Launcher and Learn about its interface.
- 3. Install Isaac Sim Compaitibility Checker and run it to check if the system requirements are met. In the result, despite that RAM is in red, other requirements are met. According to the requirements documentation, it is recommended to have 32 GB of RAM for advanced usage but not compulsory to run Isaac Sim.

- 4. Install Omniverse Cache from the Omniverse Launcher.
- 5. Download and Install Nucleus Workstation from the Omniverse Launcher.
- 6. Install Isaac Sim from the Omniverse Launcher.
- 7. Learn about the Isaac Sim App Selector, run the Isaac Sim main app and learn about the GUI of Isaac Sim..
- 8. Read Isaac Sim assets documentation and obtain assets: download four Isaac Sim asset packs from the Omniverse Launcher and combine the packs into one; then run Isaac Sim with a flag according to the documentation. Lastly, verify the layout and path of the assets.
- 9. Download Nucleus Navigator.

## 3. Learn about using Nucleus Workstation, System Monitor and Cache on Workstation according to the documentation.
- Learn about how to do Nucleus Service sharing and what can be done with System Monitor.
## Chanllenge & Solution
For the first use, loading assets in Isaac Sim takes a long time, which may be due to the network. 

Solved by looking up official documentation and downloading assets from the Omniverse Launcher.
